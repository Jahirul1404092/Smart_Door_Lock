# Smart_Door_Lock

## This project is a real time operating device which was installed at my room. I used this device for more than one year of time. Using RFID and password door can be opened. I used RDM600 sensor for receiving RFID, 4 * 4 keyboard for input password. Arduino nano as controller, 16 * 2 lcd as display, obstacle sensor for detecting door state, servo motor for opening and closing gate, additionally i used adapter, battery backup and several switch for opening gate directly.
